# MainFlow Task 7 - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) & Stock Price Prediction (ARIMA)

This repository contains **Task 7** of the **Data Science Internship** at **Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this task is to apply **Dimensionality Reduction** techniques and **Time Series Forecasting** to real-world datasets:

- 📉 **Dimensionality Reduction using PCA** – Reduced high-dimensional datasets to 2D for easier visualization and better interpretability.
- 💹 **Stock Price Prediction using ARIMA** – Analyzed historical stock price trends and forecasted future prices using statistical time series modeling.

The task involved data preprocessing, visualization, model building, evaluation, and result interpretation.
